# JavaMiniProject
Make a new folder in NeatBeansProjects as College_predictor and put the contents of the repo in it.  

"\College_predictor\src\main\java\newpackage" takes you to the files of interest, once opened in netbeans it might not be necessary to be opened from file directory instead one can open it from NetBeans itself.
